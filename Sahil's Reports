On the second day of developing a food delivery app, the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was established with key entities and their relationships:

Entities:

User: UserID, Username, Password, Email, Phone, Address
Restaurant: RestaurantID, Name, Cuisine Type, Location, Rating
Menu Item: ItemID, Name, Description, Price, RestaurantID
Order: OrderID, UserID, RestaurantID, Status, Timestamp

Relationships:

User-Order: One-to-Many
Restaurant-Menu Item: One-to-Many
Order-Menu Item: Many-to-Many
User-Payment: One-to-Many
