First Day’s summary:

Our discussion was about fundamentals of our project. Our project is a food shop focused on dumplings sales. It should have an accounting system with different types of users:
-	Seller or Merchant
-	Customer
-	Administrator

We did a brainstorm and wrote some of the scenarios for our project which it should handle.
After talking with Tariq we decided to use JavaScript and React in our app. For databases we will use Firebase.

Second Day's summary:


After our team chat about our food shop project, we're all on board with using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). 

Seeing How Things Connect:
ERD helps us draw lines between different parts of our project, like sellers, customers, and administrators. It's like a map showing how everything is linked.

Talking the Same Language:
Think of ERD as a language we all get. Whether you're a developer or not, looking at the diagram helps everyone understand our project plan.

Planning our Database:
ERD is like planning where to put each piece of information. It's our blueprint for the database, making sure things are organized and easy to find.

Focusing on What Matters:
It helps us figure out what's important for our project. Like, who are the main players (sellers, customers, administrators), and what details do we need about each of them.

Keeping Things Neat:
ERD is like organizing our stuff so that our project works faster and smoother. It makes sure we don't waste space or make things messy.

Getting Ready for the Future:
It helps us think about what might come next. ERD is like a plan that makes sure our project can grow without causing problems.

Fixing Problems Easier:
ERD is like a guide when things go wrong. It helps us find and fix issues quickly, making sure our project stays healthy over time.

In a nutshell, we're all in agreement that using ERD is like having a smart map for our food shop project – it helps us build and maintain things smoothly.

PULL REQUEST Hometask
Using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for our food shop project is like having a smart map. It helps us understand how different parts connect, ensures everyone speaks the same language, and acts as a blueprint for organizing our database. ERD focuses on what matters, keeps things neat, prepares us for the future, and makes problem-solving easier. 
In essence, it's our guide to building and maintaining a smooth-running project.
