Our chat was all about the basics of our new project - a food shop mainly selling dumplings. We figured out we need a good money tracking system that works for different kinds of users: the folks selling the dumplings (Sellers or Merchants), the people buying them (Customers), and the ones in charge of everything (Administrators).
After some brainstorming, Tariq and I agreed on using JavaScript and React to build our app. And for the database part, we're going with Firebase.
We also made a list of different situations or scenarios our project should be able to handle. This way, we're making sure our app does what it's

Using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for our food shop project is like having a smart map. It helps us understand how different parts connect, ensures everyone speaks the same language, and acts as a blueprint for organizing our database. ERD focuses on what matters, keeps things neat, prepares us for the future, and makes problem-solving easier. In essence, it's our guide to building and maintaining a smooth-running project.
